## Blog and a portfolio at once 🔥

It's scientifically proven that taking notes is best to organize knowledge. I gave it a try, and after even writing one article I improved. I learned how to publish a page at a certain domain in the network too.

### Website goals:

- Shows learning path 📈
- Summarizes my knowledge 🏫
- Publicizes my private thinkings 🤯
- Links to my programming-associated socials 🔗

For now, this website is only written in Polish. But with time I will add internationalization support with the English language.
