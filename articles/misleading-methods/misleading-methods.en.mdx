Have you ever used a method split, splice, or slice? If you had and never looked in documentation while you were using it, you are a lucky guy. I always need to take a look because all of them sound similar. However, maybe there is a way how to differentiate them? Let's see.

## Splice

`Splice` changes a structure of an array - removes elements, replaces them, or add new ones. The first argument it takes is an index that indicates starting point. The second argument is optional and specifies a count of elements to modify. Other arguments are optional too and define elements that we want to add. __However, don't forget that splice mutates a content of an array!__.

```js
// splice(start, deleteCount, element1, element2, elementN)

const array = ['zero', 'first', 'second', 'third'];

array.splice(2, 0, 'element-1', 'element-2');

["zero", "first", "element-1", "element-2", "second", "third"]
console.log(array)

// removes from index -2 (it's 2nd from the end) two elements
const removed = array.splice(-2, 2);

// ["second", "third"] 
console.log(removed);

// ["zero", "first", "element-1", "element-2"]
console.log(array)

// Removes everything from index 0 to the end
array.splice(0);

// []
console.log(array);
```

## Slice

It's very similar to `splice` but with one huge difference - returns __[shallow copy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Shallow_copy)__ of an array, so In practice we have a reference that points to this array.

If the slice returns an object of the array and one value in this array will be changed, this change will have an impact on a starting array because we are working on a reference! It's a very huge threat. When somebody makes a modification of an object later can happen weird and unexpected situations. However, we can omit this by using __[deep copy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Deep_copy)__. Then every mutation won't change both arrays.

```js
// Shallow copy
const array = [{ value: 'zero' }, { value: 'first' }, { value: 'second' }, { value: 'third' }];

const shallow = array.slice(0, 1);
shallow[0].value = 'modified';

// { value: 'modified' };
console.log(array[0]);

// Deep copy
const array2 = [{ value: 'zero' }, { value: 'first' }, { value: 'second' }, { value: 'third' }];

const deep = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(array2.slice(0, 1)));
deep[0].value = 'modified';

// { value: 'zero' };
console.log(array2[0]);
```

Slice exists on string prototype too. It allows the extraction of specific fragments of text. However, we can use it as similar as with arrays. For the first argument, it takes starting index and for a second an ending index.

```js
const introduction = 'Hi! My name is Kamil';

const name = introduction.slice(-5);

// Kamil
console.log(name);

const greeting = introduction.slice(0, 3);

// Cze≈õƒá!
console.log(greeting);
```

## Split

Split divides string for smaller parts, which later are placed in an array. It takes the separator as an argument. For example, it could be a space, comma, or even a long fragment of text.


```js
const sentence = 'It\'s a piece of cake';

// It splits on every space
const splitted = sentence.split(' ');

// ["It's", 'a', 'piece', 'of', 'cake']
console.log(splitted);
```

As a curiosity, the [spread operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax) for a string works in the same way as a split with an empty string.

```js
const sentence = 'Halooo!';

// [...sentence] -> sentence.split('')
const splitted = [...sentence]; 

// ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', 'o', 'o', '!']
console.log(sentence)
```

## Summary

Despite the big similarity, we can actually differentiate these methods. `Slice` we can use either for string or array. But `Split` and `splice` we can use only for arrays. For sure huge impact is playing our development environment when it suggests arguments that functions take. I hope that if next time I'll use those methods I wouldn't take a look at them at the documentation. But we all know how it happens in life - _our memory is good but short_ ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
