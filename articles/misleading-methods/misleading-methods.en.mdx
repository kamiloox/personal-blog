Have you ever used a method split, splice, or slice? If you had and you have never looked into documentation while using it, you are a lucky guy. I always need to take a look because all of them are so similar to each other. However, maybe there is a way how to differentiate them? Let's see.

## Splice

`Splice` changes a structure of an array - removes elements, replaces them or adds new ones. The first argument it takes is an index that indicates starting point. The second argument is optional and specifies a number of elements to modify. Other arguments are also optional and define elements that we want to add. __However, don't forget that splice mutates a content of an array!__

```js
// splice(start, deleteCount, element1, element2, elementN)

const array = ['zero', 'first', 'second', 'third'];

array.splice(2, 0, 'element-1', 'element-2');

["zero", "first", "element-1", "element-2", "second", "third"]
console.log(array)

// remove two elements from index -2 (it's 2nd from the end)
const removed = array.splice(-2, 2);

// ["second", "third"] 
console.log(removed);

// ["zero", "first", "element-1", "element-2"]
console.log(array)

// Removes everything from index 0 to the end
array.splice(0);

// []
console.log(array);
```

## Slice

Despite beeing very similar to `splice` it has one huge difference - it returns __[shallow copy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Shallow_copy)__ of an array, so in practice we have a reference that points to this array.

If the `slice` returns an object of the array and one value in this array is changed, this change will have a serious impact on a starting array - because now we will be working on a reference! It's a very huge threat. When someone will make a modification on that object later, some weird and unexpected situations can occur. We can prevent that by using __[deep copy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Deep_copy)__. Then every mutation won't change both arrays.

```js
// Shallow copy
const array = [{ value: 'zero' }, { value: 'first' }, { value: 'second' }, { value: 'third' }];

const shallow = array.slice(0, 1);
shallow[0].value = 'modified';

// { value: 'modified' };
console.log(array[0]);

// Deep copy
const array2 = [{ value: 'zero' }, { value: 'first' }, { value: 'second' }, { value: 'third' }];

const deep = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(array2.slice(0, 1)));
deep[0].value = 'modified';

// { value: 'zero' };
console.log(array2[0]);
```

We can use Slice on string prototype too. It allows to extract specific fragments of a text. It's usage is similar to an array usage. As the first argument, it takes starting index and as a second - an ending index.

```js
const introduction = 'Hi! My name is Kamil';

const name = introduction.slice(-5);

// Kamil
console.log(name);

const greeting = introduction.slice(0, 3);

// Hi!
console.log(greeting);
```

## Split

Split creates a new array with smaller parts of the string, that has been divided. It takes the separator as an argument. For example, it could be a space, comma, or even a long fragment of text.


```js
const sentence = 'It\'s a piece of cake';

// It splits on every space
const splitted = sentence.split(' ');

// ["It's", 'a', 'piece', 'of', 'cake']
console.log(splitted);
```

As a curiosity, the [spread operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax) for a string, works in the same way as a split with an empty string.

```js
const sentence = 'Halooo!';

// [...sentence] -> sentence.split('')
const splitted = [...sentence]; 

// ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', 'o', 'o', '!']
console.log(sentence)
```

## Summary

Despite the similarities, we can actually differentiate these methods. `Slice` can be used either for string or array. But `split` and `splice` can be used only for arrays. Surely, our IDE plays a huge role is while suggesting arguments that methods take. I hope that next time when I'll be using those methods I wouldn't need to take a look at the documentation. But we all know how it happens in life - _our memory is good but short_ ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
